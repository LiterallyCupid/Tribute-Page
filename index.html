      <h1>Biography</h1>
      <p class="bio_info">
        Shawn Peter Raul Mendes (born August 8, 1998) is a Canadian pop
        singer-songwriter. He gained a following in 2013, when he posted song
        covers on the video sharing platform Vine. The following year, he caught
        the attention of artist manager Andrew Gertler and Island Records A&R
        Ziggy Chareton, which led to him signing a deal with the record label.
        Mendes' self-titled debut EP was released in 2014, followed by his debut
        studio album Handwritten in 2015. Handwritten debuted atop the US
        Billboard 200, making Mendes one of five artists ever to debut at number
        one before the age of 18. The single "Stitches" reached number one in
        the UK and the top 10 in the US and Canada. Mendes' second album
        Illuminate (2016) also debuted at number one in the US, with its singles
        "Treat You Better" and "There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back" reaching the
        top 10 in several countries. His self-titled third studio album (2018)
        was supported by the lead single "In My Blood". The album's number one
        debut in the US made Mendes the third-youngest artist to achieve three
        number one albums. In 2019, he released the hit singles "If I Can't Have
        You" and "Se√±orita", with the latter peaking atop the US Billboard Hot
        100. His fourth studio album, Wonder (2020), made him the youngest male
        artist ever to top the Billboard 200 with four studio albums. Among his
        accolades, Mendes has won 13 SOCAN awards, 10 MTV Europe Music Awards,
        eight Juno Awards, eight iHeartRadio MMVAs, two American Music Awards,
        and received three nominations for a Grammy Award and one nomination for
        a Brit Award. In 2018, Time named him one of the 100 most influential
        people in the world on their annual list.
